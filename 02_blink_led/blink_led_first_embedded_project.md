>Blink LED , this is a commonly to be a first demo software for embedded system , just like to the "Hello World" to many programming language tutorial .
>
>When a development environment had set up , it is the time to make a simple but a complete software project now .
>
>Based on the hardware platforms and development tool-chains different , the whole project could be different as well .  Below given a list of projects included in this tutorial now , it will expand as more hardware platform and development tools supported .
