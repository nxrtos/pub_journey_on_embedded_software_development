# The journey on embedded software development	----  tutorial to move from bare-metal to RTOS and then toward to next generation of RTOS 



This is a project intend to serve as a tutorial , guide through from a beginner to many advanced level of software development for embedded system .  It runs step by step in practice style on projects , to present the concepts , problems , discussions and solutions . 

As it is a ongoing project , gradually drop-ins expected .  

This tutorial project is intended for anyone who interested on embedded programming . Even for high school students can started by follow the instructions step by step .  For intermediate level of embedded programmer , the beginning of parts can skipped and direct start from in the middle anywhere feel properly .  

This is an open source version derived from internal materials , make it for public . It is welcome to contact us for commercial technical or educational service .

## 01. Embedded software development environment 

Here we talk about the environment to develop software for embedded system . There are many vendors and solutions , or you can make your own tool set from distinct software tools and packages .
