# An Introduction to Embedded Systems 

An embedded system is a computer system that integrates with mechanical, electrical, and/or chemical components to _perform a dedicated function_. The general purpose operating system, in contrast, is designed for broad applications to run on top to perform varies purpose, the examples are PCs running Windows or Linux , Mac machines and Unix workstations.

Of the over ten billion processors manufactured in 2006, 98% of them went into an embedded system, only about 2% were used to build PCs, Macs, and Unix workstations.

Embedded processors range from simple 4-bit microcontrollers to powerful custom 128-bit microprocessors and specialized DSPs and network processors. Most of embedded system are microcontroller-based, therefore this tutorial emphasizes microcontrollers. A **microcontroller** (**MCU** for *microcontroller unit*) is a small chip, which contains at least one processor core along with memory and peripherals. A variety of microcontrollers are available on the market, each optimized for cost and functionalities toward specific demands.

We interact with hundreds of tiny computers every day that are embedded into our houses, our cars, our bridges, our toys, and our work. Knowing how embedded system works , learning how to programming a embedded software , is fun and be quite useful . 



There are many of articles , papers and/or books available on Internet , list some of them below for references .
