# Introduction to Embedded System 

An embedded system is a computer system, combines mechanical, electrical, and/or chemical components to perform a dedicated functionality . The general purpose computer system , on contrast ,  designed for broad applications to run on top to  perform varies purpose , the examples are PCs running Windows or Linux , Mac machines and Unix workstations . 

By statistic on year 2006 ,  over ten billion processors manufactured and 98% of them went into an embedded system , only about 2% used to build PCs, Macs, and Unix workstations.

Embedded processors span the range from simple 4-bit microcontrollers to powerful custom 128-bit microprocessors and specialized DSPs and network processors. Most of embedded system are microcontroller-based , therefor is this tutorial focused to . A **microcontroller** (**MCU** for *microcontroller unit*) is a small chip , which contains one or more processor core along with memory  and peripherals. There are many different microcontrollers available on the market , optimized to cost/functionalities toward to each specific demanding .  

We interact with hundreds of tiny computers every day that are embedded into our houses, our cars, our bridges, our toys, and our work. Knowing how embedded system works , learning how to programming a embedded software , is fun and be quite useful . 



There are many of articles , papers and/or books available on Internet , list some of them below for references .
